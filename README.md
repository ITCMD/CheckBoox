# Disclaimer

While our code is 100% open source, there are two tools we use that are not open source. These are:

- KbD.exe (An abandoned IBM command prompt tool)
  Use: Allows us to read arrow and Esc keys
- Icalc.exe
  Use: Allows us to calculate decimals and handle advanced math
  
We trust these two programs however we have no way of making them open-source. Thanks for your understanding.
Both files are read as relatively clean on VirusTotal.

What does it mean that it is not 100% clean?
  
Virustotal checks how the file is read by many antiviruses, and antiviruses are nutorious for incorrectly reading files. When only one or two triggers are activated, it means it is probably safe.
